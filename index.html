		<h4>Visualizing Income Inequality as Terrain</h4>
	</div>

		<p class="open">Los Angeles has 58 billionaires and 58,000 homeless people. In a city where destitution coexists with opulence, vast gaps in opportunity exist between neighborhoods. Let's use physical terrain as a metaphor to visualize income inequality across LA.

			<p>We set sea level equal to median US income, $59,000 per year, as a visual reference. Along the coast, affluent neighborhoods with incomes well above the US average form coastal mountain ranges. </p>
			<p>The massive plateaus of the Beverly Hills area are likely even higher, as income estimates at this scale are capped and designated as $250,000+.</p>
